"""Failing tests for the two-phase Think→Execute catalog (ADR-043).

These specify the new three-process catalog (``chat``/``build``/``fix``) that
replaces the flat five-preset catalog (``simple``/``standard``/``full``/
``chat``/``quickfix``). They are written RED — before the implementation:

* ``build_process("build")`` / ``build_process("fix")`` raise ``ValueError``
  ("Unknown process") today, so every flow-shape test fails at ``build_process``.
* ``build_process("full")`` still succeeds today, so the "full is dissolved"
  test's ``pytest.raises`` does not fire and the test fails.
* The ``build/`` and ``fix/`` prompt directories don't exist yet, so the
  prompt-resolution and git-authority tests fail on the up-front directory
  assertions.
* ``PRESET_NAMES`` is still the old five-tuple.

Covers plan §1–§4 and acceptance criteria #1, #2, #3, #4, #5.
